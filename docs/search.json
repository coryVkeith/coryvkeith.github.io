    "text": "Virus Bioreporters in planta\n\n\nPart of my passion for science is to come up with new techniques that can be adopted in cropping systems to increase the efficiency of production. This led me to design and develop a virus bioreporter in plants that can signal virus infection to technicians. The proof of concept is currently being developed in A. thaliana with funding from the NSF by way of the Center for Research on Programmable Plants Systems (CROPPS).\n\n\n\nGFP tagged nuclei in root\n\n\nCurrently this bioreporter can signal which cells are infected with a plant virus from many viral taxa, but it will be deployed as a rapid virus bioreporter to signal to farmers that viruses are in the fields, potentially impacting their yields.\n\n\n\n\nTransgenic viral resistance in planta\n\n\nViruses can’t be treated with agrochemicals because they carry out their processes inside plant cells. This means that their insect vectors (transmission agents) are often targeted through agrochemicals. This can be harmful to a number of organisms in the environment, such as pollinators. I have worked on transgenic strategies to target the virus pathogens within the plant cells such as RNAi and CRISPR.\n\n\n\nCas12a vector targeting CLCuD\n\n\nThese strategies, however, put a strong selective pressure on virus populations, which evolve to break these transgenic resistances. This resistance breaking can happen within 3 years, and can negate all of the hard work that went in to engineering plants to be resitant to viruses. In light of this, I am working on two concepts that will use techniques of synthetic regulatory networks in plants to build new, robust, transgenic resistance in plants.\n\n\n\n\nVirus surveillance\n\n\nAs researchers, breeders, and farmers try to introduce new resistant plant cultivars, plant viral populations and communities can shift in the new environment of resistance. This selection can have a signature in virus communities that can be detected. I have been working on developing automated pipelines as part of a high-throughput surveillance tool that can help aid breeders and researchers in how virus communities and populations are shifting in the environment.

    "text": "Masters Degree\n\n\nIn 2018, I graduated with a Masters in Plant Science from MSU. During this time I worked with the emerging grapevine virus, Grapevine vein clearing virus (GVCV), that Dr. Qiu’s lab team discovered as it began spreading through Missouri vineyards. Yes, Missouri has vineyards.\nBefore I came to the lab, there was no conclusive evidence from where this virus emerged. A lab mate of mine, who developed into a good friend, Sylvia Petersen had previously identified the virus in some wild relatives of cultivated grapevine, so I somehow convinced Dr. Qiu to let me take off sampling and collect many wild and cultivated plants from accross Missouri and Arkansas. I even stopped into our charming vineyards more than once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGVCV sample locations\n\n\n\n\n Missouri Wine Country\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhD Degree"
